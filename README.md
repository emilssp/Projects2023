Here is a repository with my projects as a 2nd year physics student at NTNU Trondheim.
I have been focusing on improving the readability and structure of the code. 
See mini_crystal_simulation for the most recent project.

Includes:

  - Auroras - Solving ODE. Euler's and Heun's. Electromagnetism. Lorentz force.
  - Mini_crystal_simulation - Non linear system. Lennard-Jones potential. Verlet algorithm.
  - Brownian_motion - Diffusion. Brownian motion. Sobel filter.
  - Number_recognition(ML) - Machine learning. Number recognition. MNIST dataset. SVD and ENFM factorization.
